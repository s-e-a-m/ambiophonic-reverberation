General relativity (GR), also known as the general theory of relativity (GTR),
is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and
the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity
generalizes special relativity and refines Newton's law of universal gravitation,
providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and
time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related
to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The
relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial
differential equations. %\cite{smalley_1997}
